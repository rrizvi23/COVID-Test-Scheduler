# COVID-Test-Scheduler

At the height of the pandemic in the Bay Area, COVID tests were hard to come by. Our family household includes my grandparents, both immunocompromised senior citizens. As such, members of our family had a consistent need to get COVID tests to ensure that we wouldn't be transmitting it unknowingly to my grandparents. The process of getting a COVID test was painful because the demand was so high, so I would sit on my computer refreshing COVID testing sites' websites looking for cancellations in order to book tests for myself and my family. I realized that there was a better way to do this, and created this python program to automatically book tests on people's behalf. It takes in necessary input for booking a test (name, health insurance #, DOB, etc.) and would book tests on people's behalf. I initially started using this with my family, and eventually many of my friends and family friends began asking to use the program as well to book tests on their behalf. It was a fun, quick, and rewarding project to solve a painpoint at the time.
